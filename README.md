# PRODIGY_WD_03

Game of Tic Tac Toe 

Completed a console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game using C++ for my InternPe and CodSoft task!

Here's a brief description of the code:

1. A 3x3 char type 3D array is created to represent the grid, a setup is later made in the griddraw function.
2. The placeholder function prompts the players to enter their choices.
3. Fillgrid fucntion helps in swapping the tokens with each chance and also checks for the availability of slots.
4. Winner function checks for the winning condition (horizontally, vertically and diagonally) and for the possibility of draw, based upon which it makes the decision to continue the game or end it.

I have commented out parts of the code to make it more comprehendible.
